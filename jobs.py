# Need to match people to jobs
# Filtering based on interest, skill, and depth of skill makes sense
# Need a differentiator but... that should be easy due to the way I run things we are already different by being proactive.
# Will probably need a neural network or adapt a recommendation system to it.
# May have to get wild and assign scores to each job for each candidate based on tons of metrics but idk.
